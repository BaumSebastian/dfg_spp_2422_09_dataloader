# Dataloader DFG SPP2422 Subproject 09

This is a dataloader implementation for the dataset published as part of the subproject "Robust active surface design for multi-stage sheet metal forming processes based on data- and calculation-based equivalent modelling of component springback" ([Link](https://www.ifu.uni-stuttgart.de/en/spp-2422/teilprojekte/page-00004/)).
